# Computer use Agent Full Stack Application
This application demonstrates the concept of a computer use agent by
allowing users to provide natural language instructions to control the browser and website it opens up.
It uses OpenAI's language model for instruction parsing and Selenium for browser automation ultimately 
reducing that technical barrier for non-technical users.

Example use cases for this application
- Personal browsing assistance without manually typing URL's or launching the browser
- Could be expanded to perform automated tasks like filling forms or searching for specific content online 
    increasing the accessibility of the tech world
