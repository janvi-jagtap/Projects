# Pollster
This web application allows you to create your own polls that are open for a limited time
Once a poll has been created users can vote by giving their name and picking an option, each person can only vote once counting only their most recent vote
Once a poll closes after the specified time, voting percentage statistics are given for each option
The entire web application can also be translated to Spanish
