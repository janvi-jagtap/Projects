# Welcome to my projects

## Computer Use Agent Full-Stack Application
This application demonstrates the concept of a computer-use agent by
allowing users to provide natural language instructions to control the browser and website it opens up.
It uses OpenAI's language model for instruction parsing and Selenium for browser automation ultimately 
reducing that technical barrier for non-technical users.

## Fibonacci
This web application tells you if your age is a Fibonacci number, and if not will tell you how many years until it becomes a Fibonacci number

## FlightPath
This application uses a flight database from July 2017 to allow users to 
create accounts, log into those accounts, search for flights, book those flights, pay for those flights, and list out all reservations.
It also supports transactions and can be used concurrently on different terminals.

## Highlight

## Online Chatroom
Creates a platform where you can chat with other users who are on the same platform

## Pollster
This web application allows you to create your own polls that are open for a limited time.
Once a poll has been created users can vote by giving their name and picking an option, each person can only vote once counting only their most recent vote.
Once a poll closes after the specified time, voting percentage statistics are given for each option.
The entire web application can also be translated into Spanish.
