# Welcome to my projects
This is a list of all the projects I've completed so far including a summary for each one

## Bellman-Ford

## Cipher

- Cipher: A code which is entirely made up by me
- Crazy-Caps: A code with turns every alternate letter starting with the first letter into uppercase
- Pig-latin: A code that translates the word using pig-latin rules

## Computer Use Agent 
This application demonstrates the concept of a computer-use agent by
allowing users to provide natural language instructions to control the browser and website it opens up.
It uses OpenAI's language model for instruction parsing and Selenium for browser automation ultimately 
reducing that technical barrier for non-technical users.

## Fibonacci
This web application tells you if your age is a Fibonacci number, and if not will tell you how many years until it becomes a Fibonacci number

## FlightPath
This application uses a flight database from July 2017 to allow users to 
create accounts, log into those accounts, search for flights, book those flights, pay for those flights, and list out all reservations.
It also supports transactions and can be used concurrently on different terminals.

## Highlight
Allows you to search for variations of the color you want using keywords and highlights given words using the colors you want

## Online Chatroom
Creates a platform where you can chat with other users who are on the same platform

## Pollster
This web application allows you to create your own polls that are open for a limited time.
Once a poll has been created users can vote by giving their name and picking an option, each person can only vote once counting only their most recent vote.
Once a poll closes after the specified time, voting percentage statistics are given for each option.
The entire web application can also be translated into Spanish.

- Choose a pattern A-E

- A split button that can split the selected square into fourths
- Change the selected square's color from a drop-down menu
- A merge button that merges the selected square into the square that it was split from
- A rotate button that rotates the image clockwise
