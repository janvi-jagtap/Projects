# Cipher Project
This web application allows you to encode and decode words using 3 different codes
- Cipher: A code which is entirely made up by me
- Crazy-Caps: A code with turns every alternate letter starting with the first letter into uppercase
- Pig-latin: A code that translates the word using pig-latin rules
